Object - A collection of zero or more properties
  * Is a builtin type

Property - Container that holds an object, primitive value, or function
  Has a writable attribute

Primitive Value
  One of the following built-in types:
  * Undefined
  * Null
  * Boolean
  * Number
  * String
  * Symbol

Function
  * Callable object

Method
  A function that is associated with an object via a property

Constructor
  * A function that initializes an object
  * When a constructor creates an object, that object implicitly references the constructor’s prototype property for the purpose of resolving property references. The constructor’s prototype property can be referenced by the program expression constructor.prototype, and properties added to an object’s prototype are shared, through inheritance, by all objects sharing the prototype. Alternatively, a new object may be created with an explicitly specified prototype by using the Object.create built-in function.

String
  * primitive value that is a finite ordered sequence of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer


Builtin objects:
  * the global object
  * Object
  * Function
  * Boolean
  * Symbol
  * Various Error objects
  * Math
  * Number
  * Date
  * String
  * RegExp
  * Array
  * nine different kinds of Typed Arrays whose elements all have a specific numeric data representation;
  * Map
  * Set
  * JSON
  * ArrayBuffer
  * DataView
  * generator functions
  * Promise
  * Proxy
  * Reflect

Builtin operators:
  unary operations
  multiplicative operators
  additive operators
  bitwise shift operators
  relational operators
  equality operators
  binary bitwise operators
  binary logical operators
  assignment operators
  comma operator
